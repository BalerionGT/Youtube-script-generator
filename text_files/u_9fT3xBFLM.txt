Growing up, the Bermuda
Triangle was a big deal.
The mysterious
trilateral territory
boasts tales of ships
and planes going
missing, gone without a trace.
But once speculation stops
and science steps in,
it's clear that
the whole mystery
is fairly easy to explain.
Today we're talking about
the Bermuda Triangle
and debunking the myths
surrounding this conspiracy.
But before we fly
into the unknown,

other strange occurrences
you would like to hear about.
OK, now let's get lost
in some weird history.

The one thing everybody knows
about the Bermuda Triangle is
that people go missing there.
Ever since Flight 19
and its 14 crew members
disappeared in the area in 1945,
legends of this cursed section
of sea have skyrocketed as more
and more aircraft and people
go missing.
What most people don't
appreciate about the triangle
is that it's big, really big.
While maps of the supposed
area tend to differ,
it can generally be
described as the area
spanning from Miami to San Juan,
then stretching all the way
to the island of Bermuda.
That's a pretty
hefty hunk of ocean.
All that space is smack dab
in the middle of high traffic
areas when it comes
to boats and planes.
And naturally with a lot of
traffic and a big deep ocean,
you're going to see a
lot of people go missing,
or more accurately, you're
not going to see them.
One generally curious aspect
of the Bermuda Triangle
isn't its penchant for magically
gobbling up every ship that
enters its domain.
It's the clouds, man.
The skies that float
above the triangle
are filled with unusual
hexagonal shaped clouds,
with perfectly straight
edges that can span
from 20 to 55 miles across.
We know this sounds
like something
out of Sesame Street
with all these shapes,
but the reality is
not so pleasant.
These precarious polygons
create some pretty dangerous air
blasts.
The winds they generate reach
up to 170 miles per hour
and can slam any unfortunate
vessels which happen
to be in the area at the time.
And that's not all they can do.
These clouds are also capable
of shooting the bursts of air
directly down on top of
planes, which in turn creates
45-foot waves for any ships
that survived the initial blast,
a real combo attack.
Hexagon clouds were
probably not the shape
you expected to be
the culprit here.
While we're on the
subject of storms,
we have to bring up hurricanes.
After all, the Atlantic Ocean
is just lousy with them.
And while the Atlantic
coastlines may look lovely,
they are also a veritable
hotbed for inclement weather.
Within the triangle
itself, the cold air fronts
that meet with the warm water
create the perfect cocktail
of chaotic weather.
You don't want to
be a weary water
traveler when that happens.
But as the story goes, too many
do brave the nasty tempests
and pay the price for not
respecting the triangle.
Everyone has their
theories about what
causes the disappearances
in the Bermuda Triangle.
Some say alien abductions.
Others think sea
monsters are responsible.
But one scientist,
Karl Kruszelnicki,
says he can easily explain
all the disappearances.
His theory replaces aliens with
bad weather and sea monsters
with plain old human error.
The patch of sea where the
Bermuda Triangle calls home
is a particularly
rough patch when
it comes to the sky, the
air, and, well, all of it.
Pair that with high amounts
of air and sea traffic
driven by accident prone
humans and you have
yourself a recipe for disaster.
Kruszelnicki believes the
combination of the high waves
and even higher winds
is a lethal trap
for a distracted or
inexperienced pilot or sailor.
The triangle gets a bad
rep for the sheer surplus
of ships and planes it devours.
So much so that
it is the subject
of many statistical studies.
One such study done
by Lloyd's of London
and the United
States Coast Guard
showed that in fact, the
Bermuda Triangle just
ain't that special.
The results from
the study showed
that the loss of life in cargo
is really the same percentage
wise as most any other area.
They just don't brag
about it as much.
But media bias
against the triangle
aside, you can't really define
such a large dangerous area
and then be surprised
when vessels
start to go missing there.
It's practically expected.
In your mind,
picture a big wave.
Bigger.
Bigger.
Yes, yes that's the one.
Now multiply that by about 10.
That's around how large waves
can rise up out of the ocean
at just about any
old time they want.
When the weather's
rough, it's not
surprising to see waves
up to 98 feet high.
Obviously, that's bad news for
any ships sailing the ocean
blue at that time.
But waves that high are also
capable of knocking low flying
planes right out of the sky.
The study done by
Lloyd's of London
seems to back up this
theory, and even attributes
a 49-foot sporadic wave
and sailor inexperience
as the cause for the
loss of Flight 19,
which we'll get to later.
Flight 19 was the
name given to a group
of five torpedo bombers
that became famous for going
completely MIA.
It isn't every day that
five planes, 14 airmen,
and the subsequent teams
sent to find them all
vanish without a trace.
Then the little evidence
or statistical analysis
at the time only led to a
wave of conjecture and whisper
down the lane type shenanigans.
This was the 1960s, well before
you could take the internet out
of your pocket and debunk
something instantly.
When word of the Navy
fleet disappearing
all over the Atlantic began to
spread, so did the tall tales.
Capitalizing on
this triangle frenzy
were writers that only
served to add more flame
to the fires of speculation.
In Argosy magazine, article
titled "The Deadly Bermuda
Triangle", was written
by Vincent Gaddis in 1964
and started much of the lore
surrounding the patch of water
today.
But once these stories
devolve into whimsical tales
about the lost city of
Atlantis, it becomes harder
to take them seriously.
You're going to hear
a lot of talk that
says Flight 19 was flying
in ideal conditions,
and thus, their
disappearance can only
be explained by
something other worldly.
To that, we say, hold on.
Despite what some, quote,
"historians", end quote,
will tell you about
the flying conditions
that fateful day,
we know the facts.
The most famous disappearance
in Bermuda Triangle history
was, as it turned out,
just extremely unlucky.
Since this was a
training mission,
the crew was less than
desirable for the conditions.
When they're battling 49-foot
waves in a low-flying plane,
you want an experienced
captain, which they had.
However, he was overcoming
a hangover at the time.
Hey, we've all been there, Cap.
Like a Larry David in
Curb Your Enthusiasm,
where everything just gets worse
and worse, things got worse.
Lieutenant Charles Taylor, known
for being terrible at his job,
forgot his watch and had
a malfunctioning compass.
To make matters
worse, nobody on board
seemed to even know
where they were.
So Taylor, living up
to his reputation,
made a bad decision
that led his men deeper
into the terrible
Atlantic storms
and their eventual demise,
just like Curb Your Enthusiasm.
While we're talking
about Flight 19,
we should talk about the rescue
planes sent in to find them.
They're part of this story too.
Well this crew also met
their untimely demise
in the Atlantic Ocean.
They did not simply
disappear into thin air
as the legends would
have you believe.
As is typical, this
is a detail that gets
lost in the fable of it all.
Not only did the rescue
aircraft remain visible,
it straight up exploded.
Witnesses claim they saw the
aircraft, which had already
gained the ominous nickname
of "flying gas tank",
erupt in the sky, and its
remains crash into the sea.
A subsequent investigation
found oil and debris
where the plane went down,
confirming it's ending
in this unfortunate tale.
We talked about Vincent Gaddis,
the "Mack Daddy" of all Bermuda
Triangle storytellers.
Instead of getting
bogged down with facts,
Gaddis decided his analysis
of the disappearance
would sell more copies if he
exaggerated the facts to add
an aura of mystery.
His 1964 article titled, "The
Deadly Bermuda Triangle",
delved into the notion that
the disappearances couldn't
possibly be coincidence.
Even though the
article was published
in a magazine that prided itself
as an American masterpiece
of fiction, the hype worked.
His outlandish ideas
about disappearances
in the small slice of the
world inspired other writers
and movie makers to give their
own spin on the triangle,
and that is how
legends are born.
The Mary Celeste story
is an interesting one.
A large merchant ship
has an uneventful career
until one day, it disappears.
The ship was bound for
Italy from New York
but never made it
to its destination.
It was eventually found
adrift in the Atlantic.
Its discovery didn't stop
Bermuda Triangle speculators
from blaming the missing
crew and the ship's
condition on the
three-pointed chunk of ocean.
A guy named Charles Berlitz
even penned a bestseller
called the Bermuda
Triangle, which
claimed that Mary Celeste was
another victim of the triangle.
The book was a world
renowned success,
but there was one glaring
error within the pages.
The ship was found abandoned
on a completely different side
of the Atlantic, a couple
of thousand miles away.
But if you're still
not convinced,
hey, we've got a
bridge to sell you.
As far as Bermuda
Triangle theories go,
even we have to admit this
one sounds pretty bad ass.
One explanation for
the Bermuda Triangle
claims that ships
are disappearing
into the lost city of Atlantis.
The claims of force field
surrounding the city and fire
crystals, which can
burst into pure energy,
are alleged to be the
very things bringing down
the planes and ships.
What sounds like Jason
Momoa working overtime,
may actually just
be methane gas,
which is still kind of like
talking about Jason Momoa.
Methane can become
trapped in ice molecules
and become methane hydrate.
This one admittedly
sounds like a bit
of a reach, since the last
time methane trapping would
have been around is
the Ice Age, and that's
like 15,000 years ago.
But if this were somehow
happening in the past 100
years, it would absolutely
impact ships the way
this Atlantis conspiracy
says it would.
No word on how the DC
management shake up news
affects this particular theory.
We've spent this
whole video saying
some pretty negative things
about the Bermuda Triangle.
So let's end with
all of us saying one
nice thing about the triangle.
We'll go first.
Despite its bad
reputation, the triangle
is not considered one of the
danger zones for cargo ships.
Wasn't that nice?
Sure, it has its fair
share of tropical storms
and turbulent weather.
And of course, there
are disappearances,
can't forget those.
But any cargo hauler
will tell you,
there are places so
undesirable for ships
they make the Bermuda Triangle
look like a kiddie pool.
A study in 2013 that ranked
the most hostile shipping
environments was done by the
WWF, the wildlife one, not the
hit you upside the head
with the steel chair one.
And wouldn't you
know it, the triangle
didn't even get an
honorable mention.
It turns out BT is more
preferred than the South China
Sea, the East Indies,
or the British Isles.
Maybe next year, Bermuda
Triangle, maybe next year.
So what do you think?
Do you think the triangle
is real or just nonsense?
Let us know in the
comments below.
